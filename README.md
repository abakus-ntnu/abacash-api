# AbaCash API [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/abakusbackup/abacash-api/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=b60d965e77f1a62dd4e85f65aaf90bae3865bd15)](https://circleci.com/gh/abakusbackup/abacash-api/tree/master)

## Setup
Install npm modules
```bash
npm install -g yarnpkg
yarn
```

### Setup database
#### Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
##### Mac
```bash
brew install postgresql
```

##### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

###### Configuration on Ubuntu
First, open `/etc/postgresql/X.X/main/pg_hba.conf`.
Edit the METHOD of the lines following `# IPv4 local connections` and `# IPv6 local connections` to `trust`.

Then create a role for your user
```bash
sudo creatuser -s $USER
```

#### Create the AbaCash database
Enter psql shell in default database template1
```bash
psql -d template1
```
In the psql shell run this command:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE abacash
```

## Getting Started
```bash
# With reloading (development):
$ yarn run start:watch

# Or without reloading (production):
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start
```

## Tests
```bash
$ yarn test
```

To run tests with file watch:
```bash
$ yarn run test:watch
```

To run a test a subset of the tests:
```bash
$ yarn test -- -g *pattern*
```
Here, *pattern* is a regex for the test descriptions. This also works on `yarn run test:watch`.

## Load database with test data
```
$ yarn run load-data
```
Will fill the `abacash` postgres database with fixtures from `./fixtures/`. Connection string can be set by setting environment variable `PG_URL`. Contents in the `fixtures` are not (and should not be) used for automatic testing, which means the fixtures can be edited to test the client.

## Transfer data from existing Mongodb documents
```
$ node scripts/transfer.js -d *database url* -s *system id* [-k]
```
The `-d` and `-s` options are required, `-k` is optional. The options are defined like this:
```
-h, --help              output usage information
-V, --version           output the version number
-d, --database [value]  MongoDB connection string (i.e. mongodb://localhost:27017/labamba
-s, --system-id <n>     System ID to transfer to
-k, --keep-stock        Keep stock?
```
The transfer script is dependent on an existing system.
